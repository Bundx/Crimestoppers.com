									<td>Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach</td>
									<td>Drugs and substance Abuse</td>
									<td>An Outpatient program targeting 13 to 25 year olds that aims to replace activities supporting alcohol and drug  use with positive behaviours that support recovery.The program is rated effective.Participants were more likely to seek out and continue care services,abstain from substance use (in particular,marijuana had less reported depression and internalised behaviours and more socially stable.)</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Adolescent Diversion Project</td>
									<td>Courts/Crime Prevention/Juveniles</td>
									<td>A strengths-based advocacy oriented program that diverts arrested youth from formal processing in the juvenile justice system and provides them community based services.This program is rated effective.The program is associated with a significant reduction in the rates of official deliquency of participating juveniles as compared to juveniles formally processed in the system.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Adults in the Making(AIM)</td>
									<td>Crime Preventions/Juveniles</td>
									<td>A family centered preventive intervention designed to enhance the family process and self-regulatory competence to deter escalation of alcohol use and development of substance use problems.The program is rated effective.Overall,the predesponderance of evidence indicates that the program has positive impact on deterring the use of alcohol,drugs and involvement in other risky behaviours among participants.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Dropout Prevention Programs</td>
									<td>Education-Attendance/Truancy</td>
									<td>School or community based programs targeting frequently absent students at risk of droping out of school.These programs are aimed at increasing school engagement,school attachment and academic performance of students with the main objective of increasing graduation rates and decreasing crime rates in the streets.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Hot Spots Policing</td>
									<td>Crime and Deliquency</td>
									<td>Hot spot policing straregies focus on small geographic areas or places,usually in urban settings where crime is concentrated.The practise is rated effective.The analysis suggests that hotspot policing efforts that rely on problem-oriented policing strategies generate larger crime reduction effects than those that apply traditional policing strategies in crime hotspots.</td>
